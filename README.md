# Pipeline dashboard

``npm install``

``gulp``

## Viewing real traffic data

The pipeline demo wants to display HTTP traffic amidst the microservices it displays.  To that end, it will try to connect to a [traffic-server](https://github.com/Red-Hat-Middleware-Keynote/traffic-server), which will feed traffic data into the pipeline.  You can spawn traffic "dots" by clicking your mouse, but to see real data, you'll need to clone [traffic-server](https://github.com/Red-Hat-Middleware-Keynote/traffic-server) as well.
